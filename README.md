### How to Use

The app displays venues for outdoor activities in Mumbai using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) for display purposes and the [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to fetch information about these places.

The user may filter through the locations using the input box.
Location information can be obtained by either clicking on the item in the list of clicking a marker on the map.

Caching only works in the production mode. In order to test this, you must first build the project. In the terminal, run
`npm run build`
`npm install -g serve` or `yarn global add serve`
`serve -s build`
The application can now be accessed on http://localhost:5000.
